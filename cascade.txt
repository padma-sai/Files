JPA Cascade Types

The cascade types supported by the Java Persistence Architecture are as below:

CascadeType.PERSIST : means that save() or persist() operations cascade to related entities.
CascadeType.MERGE : means that related entities are merged when the owning entity is merged.
CascadeType.REFRESH : does the same thing for the refresh() operation.
CascadeType.REMOVE : removes all related entities association with this setting when the owning entity is deleted.
CascadeType.DETACH : detaches all related entities if a “manual detach” 
occurs.

CascadeType.ALL : is shorthand for all of the above cascade operations.
The cascade configuration option accepts an array of CascadeTypes; thus, to include only refreshes and merges in the cascade operation for a One-to-Many relationship as in our example, you might see the following:


all-delete-orphan
what is orphan record ..?
an orphan record means it is a record in child table but it doesn’t have association with its parent in the application.
[ And ]
In an application, if a child record is removed from the collection and if we want to remove that child record immediately from the database, then we need to set the cascade =”all-delete-orphan”
And that’s it about this cascade attribute in hibernate, hope i explained all the values..!!
